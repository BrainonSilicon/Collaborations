## Feedback

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback on any of my material, please contact me via email, twitter, :star2: **OR** :star2: create a pull request or issue in this repo. 

## Completeness

Not every presentation I've ever given is in here and I've worked to curate this repo with presentations that can either stand alone as a resource, or can be used as a reference because there are accompanying recordings. 

I'm working on updating the repo with past presentations and if there is a particular presentation that you are interested in but can't find it here, please see the Feedback section for how to reach out.
